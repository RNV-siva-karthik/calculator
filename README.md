# calculator
i am learning this for the first time and i am in my initial days of practice so if you find any errors please let me know. 
so this is the easiest way i found to make this happen.
i am planning to add a scientific feature to this and will upload it to my next repository.
thank you and again if any errors are found please bring them to my attention.
